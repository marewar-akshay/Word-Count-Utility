# Word-Count-Utility

Language Used: Java
Design Pattern Used: Visitor pattern, Observer Pattern, Prototype Pattern.
Data Structure Used: BST

Description: Implemented visitor pattern and other design principle applied.

The purpose of this project is to design and build a Word Count system and making this work more time efficient based on the data structure we are using, using visitor design pattern. Also, I applied the prototype pattern and observer pattern to back-up the tree.
As the output, we are displaying the "Total no of words", "most frequently used word", "number of characters(without whitespaces)", "and the word based on search string, how many time it occurs"
